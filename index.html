                <span>Out of the 14 people in our class, four are wearing glasses, each with a distinct style. <a href= "https://irellavanttt.github.io/Core-2/">Evelynn</a> wears glasses with a thick black frame, while Qizhi’s are similar in color but thinner. Nandu also has black-ish colored frames, and Srinindi’s glasses are a reddish-brown shade with a small motif on the side, giving them a more decorative look.</span>
